/*
Implement a function that allows the evaluation of polynomials. 
Each polynomial is defined by a vector that contains its coefficients. 
For example, polynomial of degree 2, 3xÂ²+2x+12, has a vector of coefficients equal to [12,2,3]. 
Where the polt parameter is the vector with the polynomial coefficients, praco degree of the polynomial, ex is the value for which the polynomial should be evaluated.
