# Data Structures 1

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains practical exercises from the **Data Structures 1** course, developed in the C programming language. The code explores and implements core data structures commonly used in computer science.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- 📂 **Data organization**: Understand how to manipulate and access data using different structures (list, queue, stack, and tree).
- ⚙️ **Efficiency and performance**: Apply techniques to enhance the effectiveness of algorithms and programs.
- 🚀 **Optimization**: Reduce execution time and memory usage.
- 🔍 **Data processing**: Gain a deep understanding of how to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently.

## 🧠 Practiced Structures
- **Lists**: Insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.
- **Queues**: Enqueue and dequeue operations (FIFO).
- **Stacks**: Push/pop using pointers (LIFO).
- **Trees**:
  - Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - AVL Trees (with self-balancing)
  - Traversals: pre-order, in-order, post-order
