/*
Consider the existence of an abstract type Stack of real numbers, whose interface is defined in the file stack.h as follows:

typedef struct stack Stack;
Stack* stack_create(void);
void stack_push(Stack* p, float v);
float stack_pop(Stack* p);
int stack_empty(Stack* p);
void stack_release(Stack* p);

Without knowing the internal representation of this abstract type and having only the functions declared in the interface file:

⚫ a) Implement a function that receives a stack as a parameter and returns the value stored at its top, restoring the contents of the stack. 
This function must obey the prototype:
float top(Stack* p);

⚫ b) Implement a function that receives two stacks, p1 and p2, and passes all the elements of stack p2 to the top of stack p1. 
Note that, at the end of this function, stack p2 will be empty, and stack pl will contain all the elements of both stacks. 
This function must follow the prototype:
void concatenate_stacks(Stack* p1, Stack* p2);
This function can be implemented more easily using a recursive solution or another auxiliary stack variable to transfer the elements between the two stacks.

⚫ c) Implement a function that receives a stack as a parameter and returns a copy of that stack as a result. 
This function must follow the prototype:
Stack copy_stack(Stack* p);
At the end of the copy_stack function, the stack p received as a parameter must have its original contents. 
This function can be implemented more easily with a recursive solution or using another auxiliary stack variable.
