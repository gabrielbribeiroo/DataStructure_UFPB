/*
Consider the following statements to represent the registration of students in a subject and implement a function that prints the registration number, name, class and average of all students approved in the subject.
Assume that the strategy for approval is given by the average of the three tests (p1, p2 and p3). 
The function receives as parameters the number of students and a vector of pointers to the student data.
Implement a function that has as its return value the final average obtained by students in a given class. 
Each student's final grade is given by the average of the three tests.
